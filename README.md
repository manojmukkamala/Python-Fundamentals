# Python-Fundamentals

I have created this repository to store the code chunks I create as part of brushing my Python skills.

Official website of Python https://www.python.org

>> Python is high level, interpreted (processed at run time by the interpreter), interactive, object oriented (technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects), scripting language.

>> An identifier in Python starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits ( 0 to 9). 

>> Python is case sensitive programming language.

>> A group of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python. 

>> Comments are created using #

>> The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
For Ex: 
name = "Sun"
planets = 9

>> Standard Data Types: Numbers, String, List, Tuple, Dictionary

>> Python supports the following types of operators
    Arthimetic Operators,
    Relational operators,
    Assignment Operators (Exponential(power) calculation is done using **. Ex: a = b ** c ),
    Logical Operators,
    Bitwise Operators,
    Membership Operators,
    Identity Operators,
    
>> Python Decission Making: IF, IF...ELSE, IF...ELIF...ELSE

>> Python Loops: While, For, do..While.
If you enter infinite loop, use CTRL+C to exit the program.

>> Python Functions: A function is a block of organized, resusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Python has many buit-in functions like print() but we can also create our own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.
